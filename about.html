          <p>First, 3D printed houses are so affordable (at least half as expensive) that they can buy three traditional dwellings. For example, Apis Cor built a 410-square-foot home. The 3D printed residence cost the company roughly $10,150. ICON's 3D printed house is approximately 24h and is claimed to cost $4000. A Shanghai-based company called Winsun sold a 3D printed 10 meters wide and 6.6 meters tall home for $4,800, which is surprisingly low for 2014. The innovation, combined with developing technologies, will bring prices down and quality up.</p>
          <p>Second, in addition to the impressive price tag, 3D printed houses are more sustainable than subtractive-constructing houses. People can construct them in a durable manufacturing procedure instead of using a block of material cut. For the additive process to form, an injection mold is produced and filled with material. For example, Lou Rassey stated that H.P. High Reusability PA 12 has an 80 percent reuse rate on excess powder marked by a "4 ways additive manufacturing creates a more earth-friendly industry" (paragraph 11). It will convert carbon-heavy transportation methods in an environmentally friendly manner by printing on-demand parts digitally. The advantage of "low" waste impacts less on the environment, apart from the possibility of local manufacture. With the higher specification of the final product, outsourcing the parts and products for the entire house manufacturer will be a reality, as per the current research, which thrives on improved production volumes of similar components for various end-users. It also consists of efficient supply chains: instead of using the three logistics modalities: ground, air, and sea., Additive manufacturing creates a fourth, vastly more efficient pattern: the Cloud with a Virtual Warehouse. It is printed on-demand, rather than producing large volumes of parts or products at once and then storing them, reducing obsolescence costs significantly. As one house makes, the firm can rely on that digital design and mutate it using the "waste" materials. As more homes are produced, the less effort to allocate the creation of the structure. The wasted materials continue to be accumulated and generated into materials for a different house. Therefore, 3D printers will multiply resources as more houses are produced in the fabrication process creating a sustainable logistical supply chain. 
          </p>

          <p>Third, home buildings are available on a larger scale with less time due to the quickly fabricated large-scale physical part model or assembly using CAD data. With rapid prototyping, designers and engineers can create prototypes directly from CAD data faster than ever before and execute quick and frequent revisions of their designs based on real-world testing and feedback. With in-house 3D printing, engineers and designers can quickly iterate between digital models and physical prototypes. People can create prototypes within a day and carry out multiple assembly processes based on real-life testing and analysis results. Designers can posthaste iterate between digital models and physical prototypes and get to production faster. In-house prototyping terminates the high costs and lead time associated with outsourcing. Outsourcing 3D printing houses would help in the economies of scale for the outsourcing agents and maximize the number of parts that can be printed at a time for various customers by the outsourcing partner. A complicated product like a house is recommended to be outsourced instead of in house methods. For example, a small home (650 square feet or less) can already be within 24 hours by reaching service bureaus having high expertise.</p>
          <p>Regardless of many positive aspects, the safety regulation of 3D printing is a limited side that needs further consideration. Construction nature leads to many surface-mounted on the interior. Putting plumbing and electricity is a huge problem. This industry needs further exploration of building materials (Geocement was fire-resistant and had high compressive strength but weaker assemblies). "There are some issues and limitations associated with 3D printing such as the low stiffness and strength of the printed building materials," noted a 2019 study published in the journal Frontiers in Built Environment ( paragraph 27). Further research and regulations need to offer this printing industry for gaining trust between consumers and firms. 
          </p>
          <p>Since 3D objects consist of skinny layers, printers can make intricate, detailed architecture that would be difficult to manufacture with other methods like house need the exact specification to be livable out of space. Inhibiting other planets will not be too far since some companies have already won awards from NASA to build settlements on Mars. NASA granted $500,000 to AI SpaceFactory, a design and architecture firm that designed a home astronaut could 3D print and live on Mars. The future of owning a house on Mars is getting closer, thanks to the development of 3D printers.

              <p>Additive Manufacturing's existence is the beginning of new professions, and trillions of dollars will apply to this innovation. More importantly, one huge reason why the marriage of 3D printing and concrete casting is pushed in many sectors is waste utilization. It has brought a novel perspective and new challenges posturing new methodologies and innovative approaches to meet the global standards. Traditional manufacturing leads to much waste, but printing uses only the material necessary to create the object. The low-cost, highly customizable, fast-paced, work-site safety, and the zero-waste solution will become wholly entwined with data. It will be a massive victory for both firms and consumers.</p>

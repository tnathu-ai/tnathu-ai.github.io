I put plans into action at the time I figured the general idea through a top-down process. For instance, as the practical database project began, I conceptualized ideas, executed time, and initiated the project's structure to have a productive meeting and planning. Therefore, my team members need to perceive a high level of fit between their values and the group's values overall, which is achieving a high practical project and HD. I can find people with similar SMART goals in this Intro to IT class and look at their behavioral commitment to those goals.</p>

                  On the other hand, I am concerned about the limitation of materials. Will there be enough for a large scale of consumers to use, or will they have to wait for their turn? Another point is that physical works are known to attract labor, and it's vital for people with low education and job limitation. I wonder if, by using this new technique, can the job market be shrunk? All in all, I think your idea is fascinating and quite a breath of fresh air.

                  However, it is difficult for a developing country like Vietnam to build a house with 3D printing:
                  The cost of a large 3D printer is prohibitive, and rare construction companies will invest in this.

                  Land for housing in Vietnam is increasingly narrowed; the government prefers building apartments to use 3D printing for housing.

                  The weather would be a tremendous challenge for the quality of the house. The volatility of the weather can decrease the house's longevity over time.

                  First of all, I enjoy your idea about building houses using a 3D printer instead of physical constructions. I believe that the benefits of this will help many people, especially those with low incomes, to have a home of their own. 
                  </li>
                <li class="list-item">Khiem:
                  First of all, your idea is awe-inspiring. As you know, housing is still a massive problem in Vietnam because many low-income families cannot afford a lovely house. With a 3D printer, we can produce parts of the house with wasted materials and assemble them to make a home. The price of the house is also lower than the one that was built originally. Furthermore, the materials used to create the place are genuinely eco–friendly. It means that a large number of carbon emissions would be reduced. Instead of buying a lot of cement, sand, and bricks and putting it into the warehouse, we can manufacture materials from excess powder according to each stage to save a lot of money for preserved costs.

                <li class="list-item">Huy:
                  The idea of using additive manufacturing in housing is fascinating. It can solve the housing problem for poor people and increase its infrastructure by eliminating saggy, slum houses.

        <p class="fs-large fg-grey fw-medium mb-5">Motivation: 

          How much has a house cost on average? How long is it built? How many construction workers need to sacrifice themselves? Does evidence that people can construct a house cheaper than a month's rent in San Francisco exist? Estimation of one billion people worldwide stay in informal settlements, where structures stand on inappropriate code. Often, residents use plastic tarps and cardboard boxes to construct makeshift homes in these communities plagued by massive, deadly fires. Especially for a developing country like Vietnam, housing is still a luxury. How 3D printers solve the housing crisis, shorten construction time, utilize waste, and reduce cost will be elaborated in the following.

            <label for="name" class="fw-medium fg-grey">Additive Manufacturing, 3D printing technology will revolutionize traditional housing construction. This revolution is not a hypothesis but a fact. 3D printing distinguishes itself from the conventional machining techniques (subtractive process) that heavily rely on removing material by drilling and cutting. It is a technique that deposits material layer by layer using the head like an inkjet printer. Additive manufacturing makes three dimensional solid objects from digital media (CAD) through 3D printers. </label>

            <label for="email" class="fw-medium fg-grey">The development of practicing 3D printers to make entire structures date back to the late 1990s when developers realized that the technology used to make architectural models of systems might potentially create the buildings. Additive manufacturing can be traced back to the beginning of the 19th century, particularly in the topography and photo-sculpture fields. Nevertheless, in a Brief History of additive manufacturing and the 2009 roadmap for additive manufacturing, by Bourell et al. (2009), they characterized that "in 1972 Ciraud released the first technology that truly represented today's definition of additive manufacturing". The prolonged history of additive manufacturing provides a solid foundation for firms to appreciate and develop from it. </label>

            <label for="message" class="fw-medium fg-grey">Why is 3D printing still a "newbie" in manufacturing processes? Since the 1980s, existing 3D printing technologies' high cost and complexity, only large corporations or forced smaller companies specialized services, waiting weeks between subsequent iterations. Matthias Holweg stressed that "So instead of looking at it as a substitute for existing manufacturing, we should look to new areas where it can exploit its unique capabilities to complement traditional manufacturing processes." in the Harvard Business Review "The limits of 3D printing" ( 8-12). Traditional global logistics distribution takes its economy of scale and leverages the cost of standardized products in bulk, while 3D printing specializes in customized products. For instance, for large buildings that no 3D printing is available, subtractive manufacturing will produce massive nuts, bolts, and panels. 3D printing will produce complex parts that make the building stand out like patterns of the walls. 3D printers are still a luxury that requires expensive printers and the skill of human resources to use. It will take time for people to integrate this technology into manual construction. If they complement 3D printers, it will be a powerful tool for the firms to stand out in the housing market.
